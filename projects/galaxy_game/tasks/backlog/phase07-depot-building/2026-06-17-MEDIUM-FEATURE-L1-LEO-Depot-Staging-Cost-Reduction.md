## Goal

Create the first depot/staging task for L1 and LEO so Earth-origin items can be routed, buffered, and used more efficiently.

This task is about reducing Earth-import cost pressure and placing precision modules closer to demand. It is not the final station build.

## Context

Once Luna can produce bulk structure and shielding mass, the next bottleneck is import staging. High-value Earth components should not be flown repeatedly into the deepest parts of the network if a depot can absorb and redistribute them more cheaply.

Depots are economic infrastructure: they reduce repeated import costs, improve logistics timing, and support later station assembly.

## Scope

In scope:
- Define depot staging logic for L1 and LEO.
- Route Earth-made precision parts into staging instead of direct consumption where appropriate.
- Reduce repeated Earth-import cost pressure through buffering and reuse.
- Validate how depots interact with Luna-produced materials and shared hybrid components.

Out of scope:
- Full station habitation build.
- Artificial-gravity station optimization.
- Cycler route planning.
- Tug operations.
- Wormhole or Sol-expansion logic.

## Expected outputs

The task should show:
- Which imports belong in staging.
- Which imports should go directly to construction.
- How depots lower total cost pressure.
- Which hybrid components can be assembled at or near the depot layer.

## Success criteria

- A clear L1/LEO staging flow exists.
- Earth imports are visibly reduced in repeated handling cost.
- The AI Manager can choose staging versus direct delivery based on state.
- The task remains distinct from full station assembly.

## Review questions

- What existing logistics or cost-analysis code already supports depot staging?
- Which imports benefit most from L1 versus LEO buffering?
- How should the AI Manager decide between direct delivery and staging?
- What follow-up tasks are needed for the first station assembly phase?
