## 🎯 Today's Work (2026-07-13) — Rake Validation + Baseline Confirmation

### ✅ Rake Confirmed 17/17 — All Phases PASSED
- **db:seed:replant** completed successfully
- **luna_mission:execute** — all phases PASSED:
  - Phase 1: deploy_lspu, site_prep_foundation, deploy_comms_equipment, deploy_puh_and_ppmu, deploy_solar_rig ✅
  - Phase 2: deploy_thermal_extraction_unit, deploy_pve_unit, inflatable_tank_deployment, print_inflatable_tank_shells ✅
  - Phase 3: deploy_volatiles_storage, deploy_gas_separator, surface_preparation_unit_operations ✅
  - Phase 4: deploy_robot_charging_port, car_300_charge_cycle, isru_stockpile_initiation, construction_zone_leveling ✅
- PUH/PPMU `_mk1` blueprint id fix verified in container (resolved port schema failures)
- CAR-300 + ISRU manifest items confirmed working

### ✅ RSpec Baseline Confirmed — 4142 examples, 5 failures
- **Confirmed flaky** (baseline): `game_data_generator_spec.rb:13`, `material_lookup_service_spec.rb:251`
- **New regressions**: 2 escalation naming mismatches (`escalation_integration_spec.rb:216,228`) — 2-line fix each
- **Template drift**: `procedural_generator_spec.rb:144` — template count range may need widening

---

## 🎯 Latest Completion (2026-07-12)
✅ **Planetary View Biome Rendering** — COMPLETED
- Fixed CSS SCSS syntax errors in `_monitor_styles.scss` and `_shared.scss`
- Added defensive biome rendering check (data-driven, not DB-dependent)
- Biomes now render correctly on planetary view

### ✅ Biome Canvas Color Rendering Fix — COMPLETED (2026-07-13)
- Root cause: `visibleLayers = new Set(['terrain'])` reassignment inside init() wiped user toggles
- Fix 1: savedLayers pattern preserves user toggle state across init() calls
- Fix 2: initialized guard prevents turbo:load from double-calling init()
- Fix 3: Sphere CRUD functions merged into AdminMonitor namespace
- Cleanup: monitor_patched.js and .new*.js files removed (dead code)
- Commit: `3916a8d8` galaxyGame

---

## 🎯 Latest Completion (2026-07-11)
✅ **Atmospheric Extraction Service** — COMPLETED
- Research complete: both synthesis reports created
- Architecture locked: `BaseCraft#owner` handles ownership, no new Corporation needed
- Implementation task file committed to `backlog/current/`

### ✅ Skimmer Cycler Handshake Research — COMPLETED
- Synthesis report: `summaries/2026-07-11-RESEARCH-SKIMMER-CYCLER-HANDSHAKE-REFACTOR.md`
- Harvester variant (Local Circuit): fuel-tank-only onboard processing, offloads rest at Depot
- Tanker variant (Cycler Circuit): bulk transport, pulls LOX/CH4 from Depot reserves on docking

---

## 🎯 Previous Completion (2026-07-10)
✅ **Surface View Terrain Pipeline** — COMPLETED
- Added property-driven terrain pipeline to `surface_view.js` — 7 new methods
- Render loop Layer 0 now attempts tile lookup before elevation colour fallback
- Commit: `f152a74f` galaxyGame

### ✅ V2 Profile Path Resolution + Manifest ID Mk1 Fix + PUH Port Schema — COMPLETED
- Added `MISSIONS_V2_*` path constants to `game_data_paths.rb`
- Fixed PUH/PPMU blueprint ids with `_mk1` suffix (local JSON only)
- **Verified in container**: rake 17/17 all phases PASSED

---

## 🎯 Previous Completion (2026-07-09)
✅ **Inflatable Tank Shell Status Tracking** — COMPLETED
- Shell status written to `operational_data['shell']` when `print_shell` stage completes
- RSpec: 19 examples, 0 failures; commit: `37844c50` galaxyGame

### ✅ EscalationService No-Magic Robot Deployment — COMPLETED
- Refactored `create_automated_harvester` to use `Lookup::UnitLookupService`
- Unit type: `"hrv_400_resource_harvester_mk1"`; RSpec: 44 examples, 0 failures
- Ruby commit: `661bd2b2`; JSON force-add corrected: `068a6830`

### ✅ Blueprint Refactor to V1.4 + Missing Mass Data — COMPLETED
- Added `connection_schema`, corrected `required_materials`, added `payload_capacity_kg` to HLT
- JSON data files remain local (gitignored)

## Project History (background, rarely changes)
- **~10+ years ago**: earliest concepts in Java.
- **~2 years ago**: research and prototyping phase.
- **~Feb–Mar 2026**: RSpec stabilization period — large backlog spike generated during this crunch.
- **Mar 2026–present**: MVP focus (Luna precursor build, AI Manager service integration).

---

## Baseline & Test Status
- **RSpec Baseline (2026-07-13):** 4142 examples, 5 failures
  - 2 confirmed flaky: `game_data_generator_spec.rb:13`, `material_lookup_service_spec.rb:251`
  - 2 new regressions: `escalation_integration_spec.rb:216,228` — naming mismatch (2-line fix each)
  - 1 template drift: `procedural_generator_spec.rb:144` — range may need widening
- **Rake Baseline (2026-07-13):** 17/17 ✅ all phases PASSED — verified in container

## Pending Cleanup — Action Required Next Session

1. **Escalation spec names** — update expected strings in `escalation_integration_spec.rb:216,228` (5 min)
2. **Biome renderer spec path** — update `BIOME_ASSETS_DIR` constant to new Docker volume mount path
3. **Template drift** — widen range in `procedural_generator_spec.rb:144` if needed
