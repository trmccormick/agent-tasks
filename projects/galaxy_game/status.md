## 🎯 Today's Work (2026-08-20/21) — Template Restructure + Phase Reorganization + Verification

### TASK_TEMPLATE.md Compliance — 5 Fixes Applied ✅
- Added validation requirement at top of template
- Repositioned Agent Dispatch Interface immediately after YAML frontmatter
- Renamed section to "🔴 Agent Dispatch Interface (Required)"
- Added 8-point Task Readiness Checklist gate
- Updated DISPATCH_INTERFACE_STRATEGY comment section
- **Result**: All subsequent task files now comply

### Phase Folder Reorganization — 32 Files Canonicalized ✅
- Created 8 canonical folders: phase09-mars, phase10-venus, phase11-logistics, phase12-optional-branches, phase13-psyche, phase14-eden-expansion, phase15-snap-crisis, act02-local-bubble-expansion
- Deleted 4 empty legacy folders; renamed 2 folders
- Resolved 5 ambiguous placements with user guidance

### Blueprint Architecture Verification ✅
- COMPLETE_PHASE_STRUCTURE.md mk2 section remediated (doc update task)
- All 12 JSON blueprints parse OK
- **graphite**: FALSE POSITIVE — already exists at `data/json-data/resources/materials/chemicals/industrial/graphite.json`
- **epoxy_resin**: MISSING — needs blueprint creation (READY FOR DISPATCH)
- **fabrication_plant**: MISSING — deferred per user (Phase 11+ scope)

## 📊 Baseline & Test Status
- **RSpec Baseline:** 4714 examples, 174 failures, 55 pending (from 08-13/14 pre-push audit)
- **Rake Baseline:** 17/17 ✅ all phases PASSED — verified in container

## 📋 NEEDS_REVIEW — OPEN Entries (Summary)
| # | Date | Issue | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 07-31 | Sprite/biome/unit assets replaced with placeholders + mount architecture bug | **OPEN** — mount verified working; real sprites restored from Time Machine |
| 2 | 07-31 | Gemini Lava Tube Outpost specs review gaps | **OPEN** |
| 3 | 08-01 | Unit naming conventions (mk{num} vs codenames) — blocked on wiki reorg | **OPEN** |
| 4 | 08-02 | 19 renamed blueprints have no operational data | **OPEN** — task filed, backlog/current |
| 5 | 08-02 | Possible CNT fabricator naming collision | **OPEN** — task filed, backlog/current |
| 6 | 08-05 | Magnetosphere: 41 bodies defaulting to 0.5 | **OPEN** — low urgency, surface when Task 2 runs |
| 7 | 08-15 | **FABRICATED COMPLETION**: Data-driven celestial body task claims done but `calculate_magnetosphere_strength()` is a stub (baseline + 0.0s), test count was 30/0 not claimed 40/0 | **OPEN** — critical trust issue; see re-opened task file for details |

## 🎯 Priority Queue for Next Session

### Must Do First:
1. **Dispatch epoxy_resin blueprint** — READY, same workflow as graphite task (search → create if missing)

### Ready to Dispatch (No Sign-off Needed):
2. **Orbital Mechanics Data Layer Phase 5** — TransitEngine integration pending
3. **Launch Window + Transit Timing Engine** — Architecture feature, backlog
4. **MEDIUM bug fixes** (08-16/17) — Harvester oxygen, thermal properties, atmosphere generator nil

### Do NOT Touch This Session:
- `market-fee-hold` branch — Synthesis Report drafted, awaiting sign-off before push
- Anything touching shared/global code without Synthesis Report + approval

---

## 📝 Notes from Previous Sessions
- Agent commits use Tracy's git identity by default — commit authorship is not evidence of independent human verification.
- Green tests are not sufficient sign-off for shared/global code changes — Synthesis Report + approval required before committing, not after.
- Full-suite RSpec runs must redirect to a log file, never stream directly to a terminal/editor pane.
- A direct folder/file read outranks any written summary when they disagree about current state.
