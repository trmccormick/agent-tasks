## 🎯 LAYER OWNERSHIP DECISIONS — RESOLVED (2026-07-17)

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** — Gemini provided domain expert resolution for all 3 open design decisions

### Decision: Desert → Layer 0 (Terrain)
- Reasoning: Desert is geomorphology (sand/dunes/arid rock), not absence of vegetation
- Implication: `desert.png` moves to terrain folder; CanonicalMapService queries as terrain type
- Edge case: Barren desert = null/empty Layer 1 overlay on Layer 0 desert terrain

### Decision: Tundra → Layer 0 (Terrain)
- Reasoning: Tundra is climate-driven geology (permafrost/frozen ground), not lack of growth
- Implication: Layer 1 can overlay moss/lichen textures; simulation strips vegetation when tundra substrate dictates freezing
- Edge case: Polar regions = dormant/barren Layer 1 on tundra terrain

### Decision: Ocean → Layer 0 (Terrain)
- Reasoning: Ocean is physical water body, not ecological state — opaque base layer
- Implication: `ocean.png` moves to terrain folder; flagged as impassable/liquid in CanonicalMapService
- Edge case: Reef/kelp forest = Layer 1 overlay ON ocean substrate

### Canonical Layer Assignment Table
| Asset | Layer 0 (Terrain) | Layer 1 (Biome) | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| desert | ✅ | ❌ | Base geological substrate |
| tundra | ✅ | ❌ | Climate-controlled substrate |
| ocean | ✅ | ❌ | Opaque fluid base |
| mountains | ✅ | ❌ | Opaque geological base |

**Impact**: Layer 1 can now overlay sparse vegetation on desert/tundra when climate variables allow. CanonicalMapService implementation proceeds with clear layer ownership.

---

## 🎯 HYDROSPHERE LAYER BEHAVIOR (2026-07-17)

**Status**: ⚠️ **ARCHITECTURAL NOTE** — Important detail for Phase 4 wiki docs and CanonicalMapService

### Current Monitor View Behavior
The hydrosphere (liquid layer) in the current monitor view uses **bathtub fill logic**:
- Water fills low-elevation areas based on terrain elevation data
- Liquid layer tiles are **variable/computed**, not fixed per-tile assignments
- The surface UI abstracts this away — it's about gameplay (settlements near water, trade routes), not raw simulation data

### Implications for Layer Model
- Hydrosphere is a **computed overlay**, not a static terrain/biome assignment
- It sits between Layer 0 and Layer 1: derived from elevation + climate state, then rendered as liquid tiles
- Asset organization: liquid tiles can't be pre-assigned to folders the way desert/tundra can — they're compositional (water depth, flow state, frozen vs liquid)
- CanonicalMapService needs a special case for hydrosphere: it's not a lookup, it's a computation

### Note for Wiki Documentation
Section 6 (Simulation Engine) should document hydrosphere as a computed layer, not a static terrain type. The simulation pipeline produces hydrosphere state from elevation + climate variables; the renderer then maps that state to liquid tiles at render time.

## 🎯 Latest Completion (2026-07-16 Evening)
✅ **DESIGN FRAMEWORK FULLY OPERATIONALIZED** — All architectural gaps closed

**Session 10 Analysis Complete** (23 insights, 9 sections):
- Two-layer rendering model (Layer 0 terrain/geology, Layer 1 biome/vegetation)
- Canonical biome compression: 30+ entries → 16 canonical tiles via grouping
- Alias resolution strategy: normalize BEFORE lookup (critical bug fix)
- Rendering strategy: zoomed out → hex color, zoomed in → 32×32 tile
- Biome layer disabled for airless worlds (Luna exception)
- Cross-session validation: consistent layered architecture across S1/S3/S6/S10
- Committed: afada3b

**10-Session Consolidation Complete** (commit 3c0bbde):
- All 292 insights unified into single coherent architecture
- 7 production-ready deliverables identified
- Complete validation matrix: zero contradictions across all 10 sessions
- 5-phase implementation roadmap documented

**Gemini v2.0 Spec Integration** (commit 8ce4175):
- **Port System Operationalized**: 3 concrete types (i-beam_socket, power_bus_link, data_bus_node)
- **Asset Metadata Operationalized**: fabrication_cost_index, utility_weight, import_feasibility
- **Alias Resolution Service**: CanonicalMapService with normalize_biome() Ruby implementation
- **Canonical Biome Map**: 16 canonical tiles with complete alias resolution (JSON + Service pattern)
- **Port Schema**: Complete JSON blueprint structure with port_coordinates, connection_types, dimensions
- **Brand Enforcement**: Hard sci-fi constraint suffix for all generated assets
- **Component Assembly Logic**: Structural integrity validation rules, rejection criteria
- **Economic Hooks**: Market vs. Build decision logic with fabrication_cost_index queries
- **Documentation Mandate**: Operational rule for all future code changes

**PHASE 1 NOW FULLY SPECIFIED & READY TO CODE**:
- CanonicalMapService implementation pattern (Ruby + JSON)
- Canonical biome JSON with 16 tiles + all aliases
- Port schema with 3 connection types + port_coordinates
- Asset metadata structure integrated with blueprints
- Layer 0 (terrain) rendering foundation specified
- All integration points documented

**Result**: Complete framework + Gemini spec + implementation details = **PHASE 1 FULLY SPECIFIED**. Architecture remains evolutionary; new abstractions expected during implementation. Ready for implementation.

---

## 💬 ChatGPT Design Review (2026-07-16 Evening)

**Feedback**: Reviewed consolidated framework with ChatGPT. Excellent validation + one major architectural recommendation.

**Key Validations**:
- ✅ Separation of design from implementation (canonical biomes → JSON, alias handling → service)
- ✅ Normalization layer pattern (CanonicalMapService eliminates ambiguity)
- ✅ Port system with defined connection types (enables validation, snapping, assembly)
- ✅ Market vs Build economic model (richer gameplay than hardcoded imports)

**Important Caution**:
- ⚠️ Avoid "zero architectural gaps" framing (too strong)
- Better: "Phase 1 fully specified, architecture remains evolutionary"
- Large sims discover new abstractions during implementation (expected & healthy)
- Should not make team feel planning was wrong if architecture evolves

**Major Recommendation**: Asset Registry (First-Class System)
- Problem: Asset pipeline exists (Blueprint → Prompt → Image → Renderer) but lacks unified ownership
- Solution: Asset Registry becomes authoritative source for all visual assets
- Benefits: Regeneration strategy (update style guide, batch-regenerate all assets), versioning/traceability, faction-specific operations, scale management
- Recommendation: Phase 2 Early implementation (2-3 days after Phase 1)
- **Status**: Added to consolidated framework as LAYER 6, post-Phase 1 enhancement
- **Key Quote**: "Large simulation games almost always discover new abstractions as implementation progresses. That's normal."

---

## 💬 Gemini Design Review (2026-07-16 Evening)

**Feedback**: Reviewed consolidated framework with Gemini. Complete validation of technical soundness and implementation readiness.

**Assessment**: Framework is **technically sound and directly actionable**. It is now a **Single Source of Truth** for Galaxy Game development.

**Key Validations**:
- ✅ Prompt Automation: 5-variable template + naming convention = fully automatable pipeline
- ✅ Canonical Normalization: CanonicalMapService resolves substring fallback technical debt
- ✅ Structural Modularity: port_coordinates + connection_types enable integrity validation
- ✅ Documentation Mandate: docs/architecture/ updates adopted and enforced
- ✅ Strategic Alignment: Market vs Build, Hard Sci-Fi constraints, Simulation foundation all correct

**Implementation Recommendations** (Critical Path):
1. **Layer 0 Priority**: Render 6 terrain families first (fundamental substrate for all layers)
2. **CanonicalMapService First**: Implement before adding new tile assets (keeps lookup clean)
3. **Registry ID Structure NOW**: Define `asset_registry_id` in blueprints immediately (minimal JSON field, huge payoff for Phase 2 batch regeneration)
   - Added to blueprint schema: `"asset_registry_id": "panel_regolith_mk1_v1"`
   - Preps for Asset Registry without blocking Phase 1

**Key Quote**: "The framework is now effectively a **Single Source of Truth** for Galaxy Game development. It is ready for implementation."

## 🎯 Today's Work (2026-07-13) — Sprite Extraction & Surface View Roadmap

### ✅ Terrain Sprite Extraction Complete
- **45 terrain tiles extracted** (138×145 PNG each) from ChatGPT tileset
- Organized by family: dust (9), frozen (9), regolith (9), temperate (9), volcanic (9)
- Fixed white line artifacts (139×145 → 138×145 dimension adjustment)
- All tiles verified consistent via ImageMagick identify
- Batch workflow established: Preview.app fixed-selection extraction → immediate organization → cleanup
- **Location**: `/data/images/terrain/{family}/{type}_{variant}.png`

### ✅ Surface View Task Portfolio Created (7 tasks to backlog/current)
1. **Architecture**: Three-Layer View System (Planetary/Surface/TerrainForge) — scope boundary enforcement
2. **Foundation**: Terrain Sprite Integration — Layer 0 property-driven rendering
3. **Rendering**: Unit Layer Rendering — structures on settlement tiles
4. **Gameplay**: Civ4-Style Surface View Gameplay — city overlays, tile selection, yields
5. **Design**: Generic Terrain Improvements — roads, farms, mines, power plants
6. **Integration**: Settlement Tiles Entry Point — bridge between Surface View and TerrainForge
7. **Clarification**: Architecture refined — TerrainForge is zoomed Surface View, not separate system

### 🔑 Key Architectural Decision: Generic Assets
- All sprites GENERIC (not planet-specific): "Regolith" works on Luna/Mercury/asteroids, not just Luna
- Property-driven pipeline: (temp, pressure, geological_activity) → terrain family → sprite
- Example: Valles Marineris settlement → Surface View shows marker → zoom in → see worldhouse structure and buildings

### ⏳ Ready for Handoff
- 7 HIGH-priority tasks committed to `backlog/current/`
- Sequential dependency chain established (render foundation → gameplay layer → detail view)
- ChatGPT tileset analyzed and mapped to generic asset categories
- All tasks scoped for Qwen agent implementation
- Premium API usage conserved (38% → delegating UI work to lower-cost agent)

## 🎯 Latest Completion (2026-07-16)
✅ **Planetary Monitor Dead Code Audit + Cleanup** — RESEARCH + IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- Task file: `2026-07-13-MEDIUM-RESEARCH-PLANETARY-MONITOR-DEAD-CODE-AUDIT.md`
- Research Phase (completed 2026-07-16 morning):
  - Audited all monitor.js backup files: only `monitor_patched.js` remained (1591 lines)
  - `.new*.js` files already cleaned up previously
  - Verified sphere CRUD infrastructure exists but unused (controller + models present, no UI wiring)
  - Found zero dead code in active `monitor.js` (all 26 functions actively used)
- Implementation Phase (completed 2026-07-16 afternoon):
  - ✅ Deleted `monitor_patched.js` (dead code backup with unused sphere CRUD functions)
  - ✅ Deleted `SpheresController` (broken — called non-existent `@celestial_body.spheres` method)
  - ✅ Removed `simulation/spheres` route from routes.rb
  - ✅ Removed `#spheres` action from SimulationController
  - ✅ Verified: sphere models (Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Cryosphere, Geosphere, Biosphere) retained — used by StarSim/data loading
- Verification Results:
  - Zero broken references to deleted controller/route/action (grep verified)
  - `rails routes` confirms all remaining simulation routes intact
  - App boots without errors
- Commits: `b786a0cf` (galaxyGame cleanup), `a882257` (agent-tasks task completion)

- Fixed CSS SCSS syntax errors in `_monitor_styles.scss` and `_shared.scss`
- Added defensive biome rendering check (data-driven, not DB-dependent)
- Biomes now render correctly on planetary view

### ✅ Biome Canvas Color Rendering Fix — COMPLETED (2026-07-13)
- Root cause: `visibleLayers = new Set(['terrain'])` reassignment inside init() wiped user toggles
- Fix 1: savedLayers pattern preserves user toggle state across init() calls
- Fix 2: initialized guard prevents turbo:load from double-calling init()
- Cleanup: monitor_patched.js and .new*.js files removed (dead code)
- Commit: `3916a8d8` galaxyGame

## 🎯 Latest Completion (2026-07-17)
✅ **CanonicalMapService — Biome Alias Resolution & Canonical Tile Mapping** — COMPLETE
- Task: `2026-07-17-HIGH-PHASE1-CANONICALMAPSERVICE.md` moved backlog → active → completed
- Service file: `app/services/canonical_map_service.rb` (218 lines)
- Config file: `config/canonical_biomes.json` (63 lines, documentation)
- Test file: `spec/services/canonical_map_service_spec.rb` (554 lines, 123 examples)
- All 4 fixes applied:
  - **Fix 1**: Added `'ocean'` and `'mountains'` to CANONICAL_TILE_MAP with `layer: :terrain`; fixed `'montane'` from `:biome` → `:terrain`
  - **Fix 2**: Fixed `'jungle'` alias from `'tropical_jungle'` (invalid key) → `'tropical_rainforest'` (valid key)
  - **Fix 3**: Changed all canonical values from filenames (`'forest.png'`) to biome keys (`'forest'`) — name resolution only, not asset selection
  - **Fix 4**: Fixed `des_class` typo to `described_class`; added `is_terrain?('ocean')` and `is_terrain?('mountains')` tests
- Deliverables:
  - 32 aliases → 17 canonical keys (after adding ocean/mountains)
  - CANONICAL_TILE_MAP, TERRAIN_ASSETS, HYDROSPHERE_TILES, ALIAS_MAP (all frozen)
  - normalize(), resolve_alias(), get_layer(), is_terrain?(), valid?(), tiles_for_layer() methods

## 🎯 Latest Completion (2026-07-19)
✅ **Precursor Mission Manifest — Variance-Based Yield Correction** — COMPLETED
- Fixed `precursor_mission_manifest_v1.json`: replaced hardcoded delivery quantities with formula-based yield data shape
- `titan_delivery`: `n2_kg: 50000, ch4_kg: 25000` → `source_gases: ["N2","CH4"], harvester_count: 2, yield_formula, variance_range: [0.85, 1.15]`

✅ **ProcurementService.can_produce_locally? Research — COMPLETED**
- Task: `2026-07-11-HIGH-RESEARCH-PROCUREMENT-SERVICE-DESIGN.md` (moved backlog → active → completed)
- Gemini-generated summary had 5 gaps; filled by local codebase investigation:

**Gap 1 — Caller Analysis**: Found 3 callers with exact file:line
| Caller | File:Line | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `ProcurementService.procure_resource` | procurement_service.rb:7 | Gate before market lookup |
| `NpcPriceCalculator.can_produce_locally?` | npc_price_calculator.rb:92 | Gate local pricing eligibility |
| `MissionPlannerService` | mission_planner_service.rb:488,639 | Precursor capability validation |

**Gap 2 — Complete Unit Type Mapping**: Added Luna resources missing from Gemini summary
- Aluminum/Iron/Titanium → `metal_processor` (resource/acquisition.rb:63,428)
- Silicon → `silicon_processor` (resource/acquisition.rb:66)
- Steel → `metal_processor` + Iron+Carbon inputs (resource/acquisition.rb:69-72)

**Gap 3 — Line Numbers in All References**: Every evidence column now has specific file:line citations

**Gap 4 — facility_required Usage**: Confirmed correct pattern in NpcPriceCalculator.can_produce_locally? (npc_price_calculator.rb:201-214): query material JSON → get facility_required → check settlement units

**Gap 5 — Resource Naming Convention**: Codebase uses both strings and symbols contextually
- `Resource::Acquisition`: display name strings (`'Oxygen'`, `'Lunar Regolith'`)
- `PrecursorCapabilityService`: symbols (`:oxygen`, `:water`, `:fuel`)
- `ProcurementService`: symbols (`:oxygen`, `:water`, `:structural_carbon`)

**Key Finding**: The `NpcPriceCalculator` already implements the correct pattern. Recommended refactor is to copy that pattern into `ProcurementService` (query material JSON for facility_required, then check settlement units) rather than inventing a new blueprint-based approach.

**Updated Summary**: `summaries/summaries_2026-07-11-RESEARCH-PROCUREMENT-SERVICE-DESIGN.md` — replaced Gemini-only report with verified codebase evidence
- `venus_delivery`: `co2_kg: 75000, n2_kg: 30000` → `source_gases: ["CO2","N2"], harvester_count: 2, yield_formula, variance_range: [0.85, 1.15]`
- JSON validated locally and in Docker container (OK)
- Not committed to git (gitignored data file — edit only)

✅ **Precursor Mission Rake — Phase 2 Interplanetary Logistics** — COMPLETED
- Task: `2026-07-17-HIGH-FEATURE-PRECURSOR-MISSION-RAKE-PHASE2.md` moved backlog → active → completed
- Extended `lunar_precursor_mission_validation.rake` with `phase2_interplanetary` rake task
- 5 validation methods implemented: validate_titan_delivery, validate_venus_delivery, validate_luna_isru_production, validate_l1_leo_supply, validate_venus_refueling
- All 4 phases + Venus refueling dependency pass successfully in Docker container
- Variance-based yield data shape validated (source_gases, harvester_count, transit_days, variance_range)
- Transit timing cross-validated against profile (730d Titan ✓, 400d Venus ✓)
- All data-driven from JSON — no world-name hardcoding
- galaxyGame commit: `97607782`

✅ **ProcurementService.can_produce_locally? Research — COMPLETED**
- Task: `2026-07-11-HIGH-RESEARCH-PROCUREMENT-SERVICE-DESIGN` moved backlog → active
- Research report: `summaries/2026-07-11-RESEARCH-PROCUREMENT-SERVICE-DESIGN.md`
- Key finding: Three separate `can_produce_locally?` implementations exist; only PrecursorCapabilityService is correct
- **CORRECTION**: Prior draft recommended NpcPriceCalculator pattern — superseded. Correct fix is delegation to PrecursorCapabilityService (already wired into MissionPlannerService, uses chemical formulas)
- Proposed implementation: `ProcurementService.can_produce_locally?` → delegate via `settlement.location.celestial_body` → `PrecursorCapabilityService.new(celestial_body).can_produce_locally?(resource)`

✅ **Sphere CRUD Evaluation — DISCARD** — RESEARCH COMPLETE
- Task: `2026-07-13-MEDIUM-RESEARCH-SPHERE-CRUD-EVALUATION.md` moved backlog → completed/2026-07
- Verdict: DISCARD — Sphere CRUD not needed for MVP
- Three sphere management functions were prototype code never wired to UI or controller endpoints
- Dead code cleanup completed (Jul 16): `monitor_patched.js`, `SpheresController`, orphaned routes removed
- Sphere models retained (used by StarSim/data loading) — zero broken references
- galaxyGame commit: b786a0cf

## Project History (background, rarely changes)
- **~10+ years ago**: earliest concepts in Java.
- **~2 years ago**: research and prototyping phase.
- **~Feb–Mar 2026**: RSpec stabilization period — large backlog spike generated during this crunch.
- **Mar 2026–present**: MVP focus (Luna precursor build, AI Manager service integration).

## Baseline & Test Status
- **RSpec Baseline (2026-07-19):** 4343 examples, 4 failures, 56 pending
  - Grown by 201 examples since 2026-07-13 (4142 → 4343)
  - **2 confirmed flaky baseline**: `game_data_generator_spec.rb:13`, `material_lookup_service_spec.rb:251`
  - **2 regressions** (need investigation):
    - `planetary_monitor_spec.rb:171` — surface view rendering regression
    - `orbital_shipyard_service_spec.rb:129` — distributes materials across projects (NEW)
- **Rake Baseline (2026-07-13):** 17/17 ✅ all phases PASSED — verified in container
