# WVU Libraries Authentication — Project Status & Task Tracking
**Last Updated:** June 18, 2026

---

## Project Overview
WVU Libraries Authentication System — Centralized LDAP-based authentication gateway for `systems.lib.wvu.edu` and related internal library services. Handles staff login, temporary patron account creation, alumni account authentication, and authorization management via WVU Active Directory integration.

**Repository**: `/Users/tam0013/Documents/git/Authentication`  
**Production URL**: `https://systems.lib.wvu.edu`  
**Dev Docker**: `http://localhost:8080`  
**Stack**: PHP 8.3, Apache 2.4, MySQL 5.7, LDAP, EngineAPI framework

---

## Current Status
- **Status:** Functional (LDAP authentication operational post-kernel-patch)
- **Last Session:** 2026-06-18 (LDAP connectivity resolved, project setup initialization)
- **Known Issues:** None currently blocking; static asset symlinks available but not currently critical

---

## Active Tasks
- [None currently assigned]
- See `/Users/tam0013/Documents/git/agent-tasks/projects/wvulibraries_authentication/tasks/active/` for assigned work

---

## Backlog
- [To be populated with feature requests, maintenance items, and technical debt]
- See `/Users/tam0013/Documents/git/agent-tasks/projects/wvulibraries_authentication/tasks/backlog/` for planned work

---

## Completed Tasks
- Project setup and agent-tasks integration (2026-06-18)

---

## Task Order & Priority Notes
- All task management lives in `/Users/tam0013/Documents/git/agent-tasks/projects/wvulibraries_authentication/tasks/`
- Task lifecycle: `backlog/` → `active/` → `completed/`
- Follow agent workflow rules as documented in `/Users/tam0013/Documents/git/agent-tasks/` (README.md, TASK_TEMPLATE.md, etc.)

## Special Warnings & Conventions

### LDAP Connectivity
- **WVU-AD LDAP Server**: `ldap://wvu-ad.wvu.edu`  
- **Bind Format**: `username@wvu-ad.wvu.edu`  
- **DC**: `DC=wvu-ad,DC=wvu,DC=edu`  
- Recent production issue (2026-06-18): Kernel patching briefly disrupted LDAP connectivity (RESOLVED)

### EngineAPI Template Engine
- Centralized configuration in `/phpincludes/engineAPI/engine/config/default.php`
- Local variables control CSS/JS URLs and template rendering
- Do not hardcode LDAP URLs — always use `$engineVars['domains']['wvu-ad']` configuration

### Static Assets
- Bootstrap, jQuery, and print CSS should resolve via EngineAPI local variables
- Symlinks commented in `scripts/entrypoint.sh` — available if needed for future static asset CDN migration
- Current template paths point to `https://systems.lib.wvu.edu/css/2012/` and `https://systems.lib.wvu.edu/javascript/2012/`

### Environment Configuration
- **Never commit** `env.auth` or `env.dev.auth` files (contain secrets)
- Database credentials managed via env files
- MySQL connection uses `database.lib.wvu.edu.remote.php` in production

## Session Notes
- **2026-06-18**: Project initialization — LDAP issue was kernel-patching-related, not application code. Static asset 404s identified as cosmetic (missing CSS/JS references do not cause authentication failure). Project now integrated into agent-tasks workflow for formal task tracking and agent guidance.
